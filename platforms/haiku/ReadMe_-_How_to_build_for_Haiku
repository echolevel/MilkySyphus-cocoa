How to build MilkyTracker for Haiku

(1) Open a terminal in platforms/haiku (the directory where this ReadMe is in)

(2) Run Add_Jamfiles.sh which copies Jamfiles into the source directories
	$> ./Add_Jamfiles.sh

(3) Go two directory levels up, into the root of the sources
	$> cd ../..

(4) Run jam to build
	$> jam

(5) After a while it should complete successfully. The binaries are now at:
	src/tracker/MilkyTracker and
	src/tracker/haiku/MilkySettings/MilkySettings

If you want to clean up the source tree again you can use
	jam clean
and the Remove_Jamfiles.sh script from the platforms/haiku directory.
